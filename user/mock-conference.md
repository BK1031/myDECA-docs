# Mock Conference

Here is the page for everything to do with mock conferences on myDECA.

## Registration

First, you will need to have a myDECA account. Check out the [registration guide](registration.md) for more information.

Next, navigate to the Conferences page and select the VC Mock Conference from the list of Upcoming Conferences.

Once you are on the conference page, you should see a card to register for the mock conference. You will need to select your written and roleplay events, as well as your teammates. Make sure that you are selecting a specific event \(letter codes\), and not the mock conference category.

If you are working with a teammate, then you can add them to your written and/or roleplay using the plus button on the right. You will be greeted with a dialog listing all the other users in the chapter. Just select a teammate from this list.

Your teammate must be registered with myDECA before you will see them in the list to add them as a teammate.
{% endhint %}

Once you have filled out all the appropriate information for the mock conference, click on the register button and confirm your registration.

Once you select your written report from the menu, you will see a loading indicator to show you that it is uploading to our servers. Once the report has been successfully uploaded, you will see the status update on the page.

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't forget to make sure that you are submitting a PDF file and it is less than 25mb in size. Any other files will not be uploaded!
{% endhint %}
