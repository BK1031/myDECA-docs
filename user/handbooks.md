# Handbooks

Handbooks are a tool that can be used to track member progress throughout the year. Similar to the Boy Scout Handbook, you can create a list of tasks that members must complete before competing in conferences \(or for general progress tracking\). Handbooks can be assigned to a group, which will assign that handbook to all the users in the aforementioned group. Officers can then check off handbook items for members that are in their group.

## Creating a Handbook

> Minimum Role: `Advisor`

Navigate to the Handbooks page by clicking on the "Manage Handbooks" card on the dashboard. You should see a list of your current handbooks along with a button at the bottom to create a new handbook.

Click on the button and you will see a blank handbook with text fields at the very top of the handbook list. You can use the fields and buttons there to create a new handbook.

Once you are done and clicked the CREATE button, you should see your brand new handbook in the list!
