# Groups

You can create groups to seperate users based on event, mentor, chaperone, or anythign else! All groups have a join code that you set when creating the group. Join codes must be unique, capital, and not include any speical symbols. Each group also has a "friendly name" which is shown the user to help them identify which groups they are in.

## Joining a Group

To join a group, first click on the "My Groups" card on the dashboard.

After clicking on this, you will be greeted with an alert to fill out your group details. The name of your group will be the one that is visible to all members and users can use as a "friendly name" for your group. The join code is the code that users will use to join your group \(adding a new group from the dashboard\).

## Adding a Handbook to Group

To add a [handbook](handbooks.md), first click on a group from the list on the right. You should be greeted with an alert that looks similar to the following.

You will see a list of users who have joined the group, as well as a "Select Handbook" button at the top. If you see a button other than "Select Handbook", it means that a handbook was previously set for that group. Clicking on this button will reveal a drop-down with a list of all the handbooks you already have created.

Just select the handbook you want to add from the list, and you should see the button update. You can also quickly check whether a group has a handbook assigned to it by looking at the icon at the end of the group card.
